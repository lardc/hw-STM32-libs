12-\/Sept-\/2014 \begin{DoxyVerb}     The file is the unique include file that the application programmer
     is using in the C source code, usually in main.c. This file contains:
      - Configuration section that allows to select:
         - The STM32F3xx device used in the target application
         - To use or not the peripheralпїЅs drivers in application code(i.e. 
           code will be based on direct access to peripheralпїЅs registers 
           rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
           "#define USE_HAL_DRIVER"
